# Music


## To do

- generalized notes visualizations
	- linear can wrap around at various intervals like a guitar
	- circle forms a 3d spiral
		- circle can change the "root" note to slide through the notes
	- piano shows all 80 keys
	- guitar shows a full neck

- toggle between multiple scales
- toggle between visualization types
- some synth noises / helpers

- explore shapes defined by circle
- explore share defined by linear offsets

- derive scales from FFT
