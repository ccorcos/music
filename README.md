# Music

## To do

- multiple octave sets of notes
	- display with opacity octaves or other intervals
- color swatch to set the color of notes
- save scales to localstorage with a scale picker

- generalized visualization for sets of notes that span across octaves
	- circle forms a 3d spiral
		- circle can change the "root" note to slide through the notes
	- piano shows all 80 keys
	- guitar shows a full neck

- toggle between multiple scales
- toggle between visualization types
- some synth noises / helpers

- explore shapes defined by circle
- explore share defined by linear offsets

- derive scales from FFT

- voroni diagram of note shapes
