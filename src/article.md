Here's a scale on a piano.

We can stretch them out and look at then on a line.

Or we can wrap them on a circle.

Here's what they'd look like in an octave on a guitar.

Here's a generalization of the linear version, similar to a guitar, where you can change the offset between each row.

Notice that drawing a line of fourths (5 offset) makes the 7th mode of the major scale and drawing a line of 5ths (7 offset) makes the 4th mode. They both draw out the pentatonic scale. Interesting because this is these are 2/3 and 3/2 ratios. They also produce scales that are a reflection of each other.
